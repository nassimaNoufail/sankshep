unsupervised learning. and as I said we also have semi-supervised learning in Simon supervised learning we have a combination of label data and unlabeled data so this is labeled at the data which belong to two different classes so I can classes circles are the classes triangle in Simon supervised learning from having data from the two plus you also have unlabeled data which is indicated by the small circles. so for example for supervised learning based on the data supervised data even come up with some function and if you also have unlabeled data in addition to the label data you might try to come up with a better function. I've been very busy talking about enforcement learning in fact we will not cover.
